# CPD Project

We can use the test script  `test.sh` and the provided instances to assert the correctness of the results in an automatic way.

You can run the script with or without arguments:

- `./test.sh ` - smaller test cases only
- `./test.sh large-only`  - larger test cases only
- `./test.sh all`  - both large and smaller test cases
